# Machine Learning SVM Classifier with MongoDB
 A Support Vector Machine model running in a python and mongoDB backend, with an HTML5/CSS frontend. This project takes in a user's handwritten input and passes it to a previously trained machine learning model. Done asynchronously, to see a deployment of this project visit
